            <h2>Why Prevention is Essential</h2>
            <p>Disease prevention is the cornerstone of global health. It not only saves lives but also reduces the burden on healthcare systems. By focusing on prevention, we can address the root causes of diseases before they spread, especially in vulnerable populations.</p>

                	<h3>Vaccination</h3>
		</a>
                <p>Vaccination is one of the most effective methods of preventing infectious diseases. Immunization programs have drastically reduced, and in some cases, eradicated life-threatening diseases.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Global impact:</strong> Vaccines prevent an estimated 2 to 3 million deaths per year globally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key diseases:</strong> Polio, measles, diphtheria, and whooping cough are just a few examples of diseases that can be controlled through vaccination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Vaccine hesitancy and lack of access in low-income countries continue to pose challenges.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="prevention-box">
                <h3>Health Education</h3>
                <p>Public health education is essential in creating awareness about disease prevention. Educating people about hygiene, nutrition, and safe practices plays a critical role in reducing the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
	<nav>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Community impact:</strong> Awareness campaigns can significantly reduce the transmission of diseases like HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria.</li>
                    <li><strong>School programs:</strong> Introducing health education in schools ensures that children grow up with the knowledge to protect their health and well-being.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key areas:</strong> Education about handwashing, safe sex, and proper food handling are effective in preventing disease spread.</li>
                </ul>
	</nav>
            </div>

            <div class="prevention-box">
                <h3>Sanitation & Hygiene</h3>
                <p>Improved sanitation and hygiene practices are critical for preventing diseases, particularly in developing regions. Access to clean water, proper waste disposal, and handwashing facilities can reduce the transmission of diseases like cholera and typhoid.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Access to sanitation facilities has reduced diarrhea-related deaths by 40% in some regions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hygiene promotion:</strong> Washing hands with soap can reduce the incidence of diarrheal diseases by up to 48%.</li>
                    <li><strong>Global initiatives:</strong> Programs like WHOâ€™s Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) initiative aim to provide access to clean water and sanitation in the poorest regions.</li>
                </ul>
