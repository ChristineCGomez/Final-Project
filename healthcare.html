            <h2>Universal Health Coverage</h2>
            <p>Universal health coverage means that all individuals and communities receive the health services they need without suffering financial hardship. It includes a full spectrum of essential, high-quality services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.</p>

            <h2>Challenges in Healthcare Access</h2>
            <p>Many people around the world face challenges accessing healthcare due to cost, lack of healthcare facilities, and shortages of medical professionals. These barriers disproportionately affect vulnerable populations such as those in rural areas, low-income families, and marginalized groups.</p>

            <h2>Solutions for Improved Access</h2>
            <p>Improving access to healthcare requires a focus on building strong healthcare systems, financing healthcare services, training medical professionals, and leveraging technology for telemedicine, which brings healthcare closer to remote communities.</p>
